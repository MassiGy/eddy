# Eddy - A minimal text editor



## Motivation & Aims

Eddy was a small project that helped me learn more about how games work. I wanted to explore this realm, and since I love text editors 
( I use vim btw ), I thought it would be great to create one.

**But why creating a text editor to learn how games work ?** Well they are very similar, basically you have a setup function that prepares 
everything that the program/interface might need as resources, then you'll have the main loop in which you catch user input and update
the current state (update & rerendering). 

So that is why a text editor is not much diffrent then a game. You draw the editor interface, you enter your main loop, you listen for
user input and you redraw to the screen the updated state.
