# Basic
- Uniformize how \n are handled (do we read them, do we write them to buffer?)
- Add wrapping mechanism
- Add a prompt like feature where we can get user input
- Maybe set fallback file to stdin if no filename is passed

#  Advanced
- Add undo/redo capabilities.
- Add a copy/paste buffer.
- Add a highlighting functionality.
