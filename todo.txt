# Basic
- Add a prompt like feature where we can get user input.

#  Advanced
- Add undo/redo capabilities.
- Add a highlighting functionality.

# Bonus
- If we want to give the ability to the user to toggle wrap whenever he 
wants, we can do so by inserting \n to the text buffer and registering 
them to a list that will contain all the \n indecies that were added.
The issues is what would happen if the user removes or edit the text in 
some major way, the indecies would probably be obselet!
