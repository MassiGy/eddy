- Maybe consider reading the \n characters from the input file, not just
displaying them and writing them on save. Otherwise, you need to make sure
that you are always regarding len(line) as actual_len-1.
- Make delete word and jump word more intuitive ( it works but kinda weird )
- Add vim like motions and modes ( basic motions )
- Add a prompt like feature where we can get user input
- Add git integration on the status bar
- Maybe set fallback file to stdin if no filename is passed
- Add undo/redo capabilities.
- Add a copy/paste buffer.
- Add a highlighting functionality.
