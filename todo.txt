# Basic
- Add a prompt like feature where we can get user input.

#  Advanced
- Hash the current state before adding it to the undo stack, this will 
allow us to not add another snapshot of the current state if the 
previously added one has the same hash a.k.a the same content.
- Add TTL for the snapshots to make sure that we do not overload the 
memory ( this is a far-fetched optimisation since we do clear the redo
stack by assiging nil to it, so the garbage collector should prevent us
from being a memory hog.)

# Bonus
- Add multikey motions like dw and dd.
- Add sed integration.
- Add highlighting.
